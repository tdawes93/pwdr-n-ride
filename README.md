# Pwdr 'N' Ride

This website was built for a new snowboarding school based in Banff, Canada. The site is targeted at new and existing snowboarders looking for lessons, local events and a chance to meet likeminded people. It will provide users useful information on when, where and how much they should expect to pay to be invovled with the Pwdr 'N' Ride community. 

This website was made as fulfillment of the Milestone Project 1 for the Full-Stack Software Development Course provided by Code Institute. It was made solely using HTML and CSS with good User Design at the forefront of the focus.
