# Pwdr 'N' Ride

This website was built for a new snowboarding school based in Banff, Canada. The site is targeted at new and existing snowboarders looking for lessons, local events and a chance to meet likeminded people. It will provide users useful information on when, where and how much they should expect to pay to be invovled with the Pwdr 'N' Ride community. 

This website was made as fulfillment of the Milestone Project 1 for the Full-Stack Software Development Course provided by Code Institute. It was made solely using HTML and CSS with good User Design at the forefront of the focus. 

The live website can be found here (link to site)

### Structure

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

- The three main colours used were a White #FDFBFC, Light Slate Gray #698A9B and Spanish Gray #9A999E. These colours were taken from the hero image to compliment the image and were picked to mimic colours often seen in snowy mountains. 

- The book now buttons are in Flame #EA591F. This creates an excitment and a large contrast to the other more subtle colours allowing and encouraging the user to notice and press the button immediately.

- The majority of the text is coloured in Jet #2D2C2A to add contrast and clarity to the text.

#### Typography

- Bebas-Neue is used for the headers throughout the site. It is a clean uniform font similar in style to those found on popular snowboard art work.

- The font used for the main text is Cabin. It is slightly more rounded whilst remaining clean and uniform to blend with Bebas-Neue.

- Both fonts have a sans-serif back-up. 

#### Imagery

- The hero image is a striking and exciting shot, chosen to inspire both new and experienced snowboarders.

- The images in the events and booking pages were selected to represent what they are advertising. They were chosen to create excitement whilst putting any nerves to rest.

- The images have been resized to be responsive and their placement varies depending on the device used.
